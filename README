taskproc (task processor) is a simple Python module designed for
running a set of tasks which can have dependencies on each other. The
idea is to have a make-like dependency resolution within a Python
program. Tasks are queued for execution until their requirements are
met. When executed, tasks can return a value which is then passed down
to dependent tasks.

There are two modes of task execution: simple execution of tasks in
the main program or multi-threaded execution.

taskproc is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and is copyright

3.2+.
